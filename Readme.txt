This program demonstrates the use of an array of particles with a very basic physics engine to make a nice looking fountain effect.
It uses very simple graphics (PSet), no fancy DirectX or even any BitBlt. Great for beginners.
If you're running an old operating system or have a very slow processor, you may want to set LowSpecs to true in modFountain. This will shift CPU priority towards the OS and away from the program, making the system more stable during runtime. Unfortunately this will decrease the performance of the program.

Features:
* Smooth, efficient running
* Change particle spawning at runtime
* Instant Particle Respawning (IPR)

Changes from v1.1 to v1.2:
* Fixed Exit button (forgot to code it last time, doh!)
* Added draw width controls (How large each pixel is)
* Added Auto Redraw option (Decreases flicker, but decreases performance)
